TODO: look up (in the Bodyguard source) how to use a "shim" to intercept C
library functions.  It should be pretty easy to intercept mmap(), when we
finally want to implement that - although intercepting the mmap *system call*
will be much harder (we would have to leverage the UML strategies to make that
work).

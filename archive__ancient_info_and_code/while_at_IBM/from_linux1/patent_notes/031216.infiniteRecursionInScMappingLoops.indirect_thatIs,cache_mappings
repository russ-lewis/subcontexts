PROBLEM:

If we are going to recurse into the subcontext mapping tree, we have the
potential for infinite recursion.  We need a way to prevent that.

DETAILS:



THINGS I TRIED:

foo

details............

bar

details............

SOLUTION:

When searching a given subcontext for a mapping to another subcontext, first
populate the indirect_mapping list.  Don't recurse; instead, iterate on the
list until you can find no new mappings.

Then, simply do a linear search on the list to find out if this sc has enough
permissions to access the other sc.

Soon, we'll have to cache the indirect_mapping list in the subcontext and
provide some mechanism for showing when this list is out of date.  For the
first version, however, don't store this; just regenerate it each time you
use it (while holding a read lock on the mmap_sem of each subcontext you
encounter).

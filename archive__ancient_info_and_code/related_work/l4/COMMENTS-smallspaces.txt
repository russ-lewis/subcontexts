SMALL SPACES

This uses the observation (something I didn't know) that the x86 segment
registers allow you to do an early virtual->virtual mapping.  Thus, if you have
a number of applications which all use fairly little memory, you can map them
to non-overlapping (contiguous) ranges in the same address space, and use
segment registers to control how application virtual addresses are mapped to
the address space.  Thus, you can perform a context switch simply by changing
the segment registers; you don't have to actually change the page table and
flush the TLB.

While this doesn't replace subcons, it is an interesting potential performance
improvement for the x86 implementation of subcons.

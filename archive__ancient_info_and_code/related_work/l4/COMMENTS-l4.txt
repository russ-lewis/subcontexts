L4

L4 is another microkernel with very, very trivial interfaces.  It is designed
to have portable interfaces, and as tiny as possible, based on the observation
that existing microkernels were very architecture-specific and were also
getting pretty large.

Its basic memory system allows for "maps" of a page (a process gives another
process revokable access to a page) and "grants" (a process irrevocably gives
the other process the page, losing access to it at the same time).  Neither
solves the problem of how you automatically and instantly share the pages of a
component across multiple users.

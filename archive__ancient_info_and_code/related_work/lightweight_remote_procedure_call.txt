Relevance to subcons:
---------------------
  - Discusses the desire for fast RPC
  - Demonstrates that most calls are pass-by-value (mentioning in passing
    that this is a *consequence* of the existing RPC designs)

  - Uses marshalling stub
  - *NOT* single-address-space

  - Arguments passed on an "A-stack".
    - Shared resource between caller, server
    - *NOT* at same address in both
    - *NOT* permanently mmap()ed in

  - Still needs kernel to mediate the call

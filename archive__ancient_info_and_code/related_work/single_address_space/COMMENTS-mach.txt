Mach doesn't have much connection to subcontexts, except for the general
concept of a microkernel.  Its virtual memory system doesn't allow any new
features; most importantly, it doesn't allow for a service's memory to be
synchronously shared between two contexts.  It does allow shared memory pages,
but only when they are inherited from a parent process to a child, and never
dynamically allocated.
